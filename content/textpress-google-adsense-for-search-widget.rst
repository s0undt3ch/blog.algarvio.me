This TextPress widget enables search on your blog using Google Adsense For Search

First, you should go to your `Google Adsense <http://www.google.com/adsense>`__
account and create the code for *Adsense for Search*. You **must** choose to display
the results on your own site.

Here are some warnings displayed by the plugin configuration:

.. warning::
  **You must set all of the plugin settings!**
  Failing to do so, will throw an error, with the exception for **Safe Contents** and
  ``Channel``. Most of the values you need to put here will be ``copy/paste``'ed
  from the code that Google AdSense For Search gives you, pay attention to that.

  **Failing to do so, might compromise your commitment with Google AdSense and the policy
  that google obliges you to follow**.

.. warning::
  In order to get the right code to *``copy/paste``* in this plugin, **make sure** you specify
  that you want to *"Open results within my own site"*.
  **This IS Important!!!** Not doing this will probably make the results ``IFRAME`` not show up.


.. warning::
  I here by state that I won’t be held responsible for breaking your Google AdSense policy because
  you’re using a plugin I coded. Yet, all attempts were made to make sure the resulting code is
  exactly like the one Google gives us.
  **Use At Your Own Risk!**

You have been warned :)

Make good use of the plugin if you wish to use it.
