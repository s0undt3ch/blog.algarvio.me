**Irssi Notifier 0.2.0RC4 Released**

This is hopefully the last release candidate before the [0.2.0](http://irssinotifier.ufsoft.org/milestone/0.2.0) version
release.

It includes some bug fixes and some missing files on the distributed
egg.

If you'd like to provide a translation in your language, please, [drop me an email](mailto:ufs@ufsoft.org) or
[file a ticket](http://irssinotifier.ufsoft.org/newticket), stating what's the language and locale you'd like to provide the
translation for, and I’ll gladly provide you a file for translation which will be
included in the next release.

For any bugs you find, please [file a ticket](http://irssinotifier.ufsoft.org/newticket) with all info you can gather so it can be
fixed.

Happy use of **Irssi Notitifier**.
