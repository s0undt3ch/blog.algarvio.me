This TextPress widget enables search on your blog using Google Adsense For Search

First, you should go to your [Google Adsense](http://www.google.com/adsense)
account and create the code for _Adsense for Search_. You **must** choose to display
the results on your own site.

Here are some warnings displayed by the plugin configuration:

> :warning: WARNING
>
> **You must set all of the plugin settings!**
> Failing to do so, will throw an error, with the exception for **Safe Contents** and
> `Channel`. Most of the values you need to put here will be `copy/paste`'ed
> from the code that Google AdSense For Search gives you, pay attention to that.
>
> **Failing to do so, might compromise your commitment with Google AdSense and the policy
> that google obliges you to follow**.

> :warning: WARNING
>
> In order to get the right code to _`copy/paste`_ in this plugin, **make sure** you specify
> that you want to _"Open results within my own site"_.
> **This IS Important!!!** Not doing this will probably make the results `IFRAME` not show up.

> :warning: WARNING
>
> I here by state that I won’t be held responsible for breaking your Google AdSense policy because
> you’re using a plugin I coded. Yet, all attempts were made to make sure the resulting code is
> exactly like the one Google gives us.
> **Use At Your Own Risk!**

You have been warned :)
