Welcome to my first blog online.

I’ve created this blog because of my [python](https://python.org) (and not only) code developments. Some
of the projects I code are too small to have a full development site, so, I’ve decided
to create a blog to post those small projects and get some feedback about them.

Of course, if the projects do get bigger, they’ll probably get their own
site **`:)`**

Well, that’s it for my first post on my first blog...
