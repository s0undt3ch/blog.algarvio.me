**Fuck You ATI!!!!!!**

Ever since I bought my laptop which is **UNFORTUNATELY** attached to an
ATI card, I’ve had issues running it on Linux! And now you tell me that
you’re dropping support!? This laptop is not 2 years old!!!! Now What!?

If I could, believe me, I’d buy a new laptop and would make **SURE**
there wasn’t anything ATI inside, in fact, be sure that you won’t
**EVER** again see a penny from me!!!!
