**Irssi Notifier 0.2.0RC4 Released**

This is hopefully the last release candidate before the `0.2.0`__ version
release.

It includes some bug fixes and some missing files on the distributed
egg.

For detailed info on all changes please see the `ChangeLog`__.


If you'd like to provide a translation in your language, please, `drop me an email`__ or
`file a ticket`__, stating what's the language and locale you'd like to provide the
translation for, and Iâ€™ll gladly provide you a file for translation which will be
included in the next release.

For any bugs you find, please `file a ticket`__ with all info you can gather so it can be
fixed.

Happy use of **Irssi Notitifier**.
